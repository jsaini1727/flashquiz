# Flash QUiz

## Description
```
This has been the toughest project for me by far in my life. This was largely owing to the fact that there were variables, there were functions and there were the for loops. It was the names that got me confused. These names were variable names, function names and last but not the least names in the HTML files which were being used to capture the targeted information. I had to use the knowledge but it was my ability to understand and apply that made me finish the line. Now you can enjoy a small quiz thanks to these abilities which I have acquired and also see how well you have done. My journey to reach Mars continues ........
